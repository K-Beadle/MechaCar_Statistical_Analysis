# Mechacar Analysis

## Overview
- AutosRU's newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team's progress. Management has set a task to review production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

### Tasks
  - Performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
  - Collected summary statistics on the pounds per square inch of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
  - Ran t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
  - Designed a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. Included summary interpretation of findings for each statistical analysis.


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
